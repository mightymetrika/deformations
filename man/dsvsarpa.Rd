\title{Deformation of Sphere's Volume and Surface Area to Regular Polyhedron Surface Area}
\usage{
dsvsarpa(n, r = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer vector specifying Platonic solid by number of faces.
Must be one of: 4 (tetrahedron), 6 (cube), 8 (octahedron),
12 (dodecahedron), 20 (icosahedron).}

\item{r}{Numeric vector of sphere radius/radii (must be positive). Default is 1.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of surface area deformity values
}
\description{
Calculates the surface area discrepancy when transforming a sphere into a
Platonic solid. This measures the difference between the surface area of a
polyhedron derived from volume-conserving edge length versus the surface area
derived from surface-area-conserving edge length. This is the 3D analog of
dcaprpa and complements dsvsarps by measuring area rather than edge length discrepancy.

\details{
Calculate Sphere-to-Platonic-Solid Surface Area Deformity

The function computes:
\deqn{d_{n,area} = A_{volume} - A_{surface}}

Where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{A_{volume}} is the surface area of polyhedron with volume-preserving edge length
\item \eqn{A_{surface} = 4\pi r^2} is the surface area with surface-area-preserving edge length
}

For each Platonic solid with edge length a:
\itemize{
\item Tetrahedron (n=4): Surface area = √3 a²
\item Cube (n=6): Surface area = 6a²
\item Octahedron (n=8): Surface area = 2√3 a²
\item Dodecahedron (n=12): Surface area = 3√(25+10√5) a²
\item Icosahedron (n=20): Surface area = 5√3 a²
}

The surface area deformity represents how much the competing constraints
(volume vs surface area conservation) affect the total surface area when
transforming a sphere into a Platonic solid.
