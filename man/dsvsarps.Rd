\title{Deformation of Sphere's Volume and Surface Area to Regular Polyhedron Side}
\usage{
dsvsarps(n, r = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer vector specifying Platonic solid by number of faces.
Must be one of: 4 (tetrahedron), 6 (cube), 8 (octahedron),
12 (dodecahedron), 20 (icosahedron).}

\item{r}{Numeric vector of sphere radius/radii (must be positive). Default is 1.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of edge length deformity values
}
\description{
Calculates the geometric inconsistency when transforming a sphere into a
Platonic solid (regular polyhedron), measuring the difference between edge
lengths derived from volume conservation versus surface area conservation.
This is the 3D analog of dcaprps for regular polygons.

\details{
Calculate Sphere-to-Platonic-Solid Side Length Deformity

The function computes:
\deqn{d_n = a_{volume} - a_{surface}}

Where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{a_{volume}} is the edge length making polyhedron volume = sphere volume
\item \eqn{a_{surface}} is the edge length making polyhedron surface area = sphere surface area
}

For each Platonic solid:
\itemize{
\item Tetrahedron (n=4): Volume = a³/(6√2), Surface = √3 a²
\item Cube (n=6): Volume = a³, Surface = 6a²
\item Octahedron (n=8): Volume = (√2/3)a³, Surface = 2√3 a²
\item Dodecahedron (n=12): Volume = a³(15+7√5)/4, Surface = 3√(25+10√5) a²
\item Icosahedron (n=20): Volume = (5/12)(3+√5)a³, Surface = 5√3 a²
}
}
\examples{
# Basic usage
dsvsarps(4)   # Tetrahedron deformity
dsvsarps(6)   # Cube deformity
dsvsarps(8)   # Octahedron deformity

# All Platonic solids
dsvsarps(c(4, 6, 8, 12, 20))

# Compare with 2D analog
dsvsarps(6)   # 3D cube
dcaprps(4)    # 2D square

# Different sphere sizes
dsvsarps(6, r = 2)
