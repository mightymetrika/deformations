\title{Deformation of Circle's Area and Perimeter to Regular Polygon Side}
\usage{
dcaprps(n, r = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer vector of polygon sides (must be >= 3). The number of sides
of the target regular polygon(s).}

\item{r}{Numeric vector of circle radius/radii (must be positive). Default is 1.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of deformity values, one for each combination of n and r.
Positive values indicate that the area-preserving side length is greater than
the perimeter-preserving side length.
}
\description{
Calculates the geometric inconsistency (deformity) that arises when transforming
a circle into a regular polygon. This deformity measures the difference between
two different methods of determining the polygon's side length: one based on
conserving the circle's area, and another based on conserving the circle's perimeter.
Since both area and perimeter cannot be simultaneously preserved during this
transformation, the resulting discrepancy quantifies the geometric "cost" of the
shape transformation.

\details{
Calculate Circle-to-Regular-Polygon Deformity

The function computes:
\deqn{d_n = s_{area} - s_{perimeter}}

Where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{s_{area} = 2r\sqrt{\frac{\pi \tan(\pi/n)}{n}}} (side length preserving area)
\item \eqn{s_{perimeter} = \frac{2\pi r}{n}} (side length preserving perimeter)
}

The deformity represents a fundamental geometric inconsistency: when transforming
a circle (area = \eqn{\pi r^2}, perimeter = \eqn{2\pi r}) to a regular n-gon,
different invariants (area vs. perimeter) suggest different target geometries.

As n approaches infinity, the deformity approaches zero, reflecting that regular
polygons approach circles in the limit.

# Basic usage
dcaprps(3)  # Triangle deformity with unit circle
dcaprps(4)  # Square deformity with unit circle

# Multiple polygons
dcaprps(3:8)  # Deformities for triangle through octagon

# Different circle sizes
dcaprps(4, r = 2)  # Square deformity with radius 2
dcaprps(3, r = c(1, 2, 3))  # Multiple r values

# Explore the relationship between n and deformity
n_vals <- 3:20
deformities <- dcaprps(n_vals)
