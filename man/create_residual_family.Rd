\title{Generate Residual Shapes from Deformity Values}
\usage{
create_residual_family(initial_shape, target_shape, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{initial_shape}{Character. Type of initial shape: "circle", "sphere"}

\item{target_shape}{Character. Type of target shape: "triangle", "square",
"pentagon", etc., or "tetrahedron", "cube", "octahedron", etc.}

\item{...}{Parameters for the initial shape (e.g., r for radius, a,b for ellipse)}
}
\value{
Object of class "residual_family" containing:
\itemize{
\item initial_params: Parameters of the initial shape
\item target_info: Information about target shape
\item deformities: All computed deformity values
\item residuals: List of residual shapes with their properties
\item relationships: Mathematical relationships between residuals
}
}
\description{
Creates a family of "residual" shapes by using deformity values as construction
parameters. Instead of just measuring geometric inconsistency, this function
uses those inconsistencies to generate new shapes where the deformity becomes
the actual dimensional parameter.
